tab# Installation

Add the `jitpack.io` Maven repository to your `root/build.gradle.kts` file. For example:

`esc``gradle
allprojects {
 repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
 }
}
```

In `app/build.gradle.kts` add the WalletKit package and its dependencies:

`tab``gradle
implementation("com.walletconnect:android-core:release_version")
implementation("com.walletconnect:web3wallet:release_version")
```
